# SolarWeedKiller
This project is inspired by [NathanBuildsDIY](https://www.youtube.com/@nathanbuildsdiy) and his project [DIY AI Weed Burner Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVJXskpkuEE) thanks a lot to him for sharing his idea!

## Basics
His idea has captivated me for weeks now. I would like to build on his idea and develop a vehicle that farmers can use in their fields. The basic idea is that as far as possible all components are taken from the 3D printer or a hardware store.

## Ideas for the project
The plan is to use a mirror between the sun and the lens to work even when the sun is low to add more working time. This also adds the ability to shine the Beam from the side under the plants.
